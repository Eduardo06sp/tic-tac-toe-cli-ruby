# tic-tac-toe-cli-ruby

In this project, I built a simple game of tic-tac-toe which is played in the terminal. It is a two player match, and each player takes turn marking the board.

The user is first asked whether or not they would like to play. Then, after validating the user's input, the user is prompted to name each player and player 1's marker (or sign). They take turns filling in the empty spaces on the board (marked with numbers 1-9) until either player wins, or the game ends in a tie.

Among the skills assumed for such a task, I learned to:

* Be persistent, but know when to ask for help if I am having trouble

* Use classes. I used the GenerateNewGame class to store instance variables for each new game.

* Use getter and setter methods to view and modify instance variables.

* Use class variables to track state of class

* Use initialize method to create instance variables to create default values for each game instance

* Create a simple method that takes parameters used to validate any user input necessary

* Modify instance variables

* Use two-dimensional array to hold multiple arrays

* Use ternary operator to condense code
